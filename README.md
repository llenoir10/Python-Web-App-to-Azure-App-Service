**Deploying a Python Web App to Azure with CI/CD**

This project demonstrates my ability to build and deploy a Python web application to the cloud using **Azure App Service** and **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

I developed a lightweight web app using **Flask** (customizable to FastAPI), version-controlled it with **GitHub**, and created a fully automated workflow that:

* Tests and packages the app on every push to `main`
* Deploys the latest version to Azure App Service using a secure publish profile
* Logs the entire deployment process for easy monitoring and troubleshooting

By integrating **GitHub Secrets** and **Azure CLI**, I ensured that sensitive credentials were protected and the deployment pipeline remained secure and scalable.
